Consider the combination reaction:
\[ 2\chemical{Al}[2] + \chemical{Al} + \chemical{Al}[1] \]

\section{Percent Yield}\label{sec:percent-yield}
The percent yield can be determined by comparing the amount actually obtained (actual yield) to the amount it was possible to make (theoretical yield).

\begin{equation}
	\mbox{Percent Yield} = \frac{\mbox{Actual Yield}}{\mbox{Theoretical Yield}} * 100
	\label{eq:percent-yield}
\end{equation}
